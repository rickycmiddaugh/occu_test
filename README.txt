OCCU Test

Author: Richard Middaugh <rickycmiddaugh@gmail.com>

This project is an example of an MVC architecture, written in PHP 7.4.5. The code is written entirely by hand with no MVC framework help.
It should be installed into /occu from the root of the server to get PHP includes to work properly.
